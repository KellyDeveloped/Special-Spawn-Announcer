# Special Spawn Announcer
## Description

This mod plays a sound when the game spawns a specialist unit. Darktide does an awful job at announcing some of of these units, which gave rise to this mod.

<b>Note</b>\: not all specials are supported yet as I've not found a suitable sound for them.

### Supported Specials

## Limitations
I suck at BBCode, so please check out the limitaitons mentioned from the [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/217]UnlimitedPower mod[/url]. `Special Spawn Announcer` was based on this, so it has the same limitations.

## Credits
 * Big shout to JCaleb. The UnlimitedPower mod inspired me to write this, and was used as a project base.
 * Everyone on Reddit who has complained profusely about snipers never making a sound
